**Sentiment as a Time Series: Discourse-Level Analysis of Political Speeches**

## Overview

This project moves beyond document-level sentiment classification and instead analyzes how sentiment evolves throughout a speech. Rather than assigning a single polarity score to an entire document, the speech is segmented into sentences and sentiment is computed at each time step. This allows sentiment to be treated as a time series and interpreted in relation to rhetorical structure.

Three speeches from the American Rhetoric Top 100 list were selected:

* Inaugural Address (JFK, 1961)
* Farewell Address
* Checkers Speech

The objective is to examine emotional progression, detect turning points, and compare structural patterns across speeches.

## Methodology

### 1. Sentence Segmentation

Each speech was segmented into sentences using a rule-based regular expression that splits text at sentence-ending punctuation. This ensures that sentiment is calculated at the sentence level.

### 2. Sentiment Scoring

Each sentence was assigned a polarity score using TextBlob sentiment analysis. Scores range from:

* -1 (very negative)
* 0 (neutral)
* +1 (very positive)

### 3. Temporal Indexing

Sentences were indexed in sequential order to represent time. Additionally, time was normalized between 0 and 1 to allow comparison between speeches of different lengths.

### 4. Time Series Construction

For each speech, a sentiment time series was constructed:

* x-axis: sentence index (or normalized time)
* y-axis: sentiment score

Summary statistics were computed:

* Mean sentiment of first quartile
* Mean sentiment of last quartile
* End-minus-start difference
* Linear trend (slope)
* Standard deviation (emotional volatility)

## Findings

### Tone Progression

All three speeches show an overall upward emotional trajectory, ending more positively than they begin.

* **Inaugural Address** shows the strongest increase in sentiment, reflecting a rhetorical build toward unity and inspiration.
* **Farewell Address** exhibits a moderate upward trend, with cautionary elements balanced by hopeful conclusions.
* **Checkers Speech** shows minimal overall trend but high emotional volatility, with significant peaks and dips corresponding to personal and defensive appeals.

### Emotional Turning Points

Sentiment peaks align with rhetorical shifts such as:

* Calls to unity
* Appeals to freedom or national purpose
* Personal or emotionally charged narratives

Negative troughs typically correspond to:

* References to war, danger, or political threat
* Acknowledgment of national or global challenges

### Structural Patterns

Despite differences in context and purpose, the speeches share a similar rhetorical arc:

1. Formal or contextual introduction
2. Identification of challenges
3. Moral or ideological framing
4. Positive or motivational conclusion

The sentiment time series mirrors this structure, demonstrating how emotional progression reinforces persuasive intent.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that sentiment analysis can be extended beyond document classification to capture dynamic emotional structure within discourse. Treating sentiment as a time series reveals how speakers strategically manage tone across a speech to guide audience perception, build tension, and conclude with impact.

By combining sentence-level sentiment scoring with temporal indexing, the analysis provides quantitative support for classical rhetorical theory regarding emotional build-up and resolution.
